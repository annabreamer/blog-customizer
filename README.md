# Project "Blog Customizer"
https://annabreamer.github.io/blog-customizer/
## Overview
This project customizes a blog page through an interactive sidebar panel. I enhanced the starter components by adding state management, event handlers, and data passing between the form and the main page. The sidebar toggles open and closed, allowing users to adjust CSS variable settings for the blog layout, with changes applied only after clicking "Apply" or reset to defaults via "Reset." This implementation creates a dynamic, user-friendly interface for blog customization.

## Technologies Used
**HTML5, CSS3** (responsive design, CSS variables)**, JavaScript** (React)**, Git, Figma**
